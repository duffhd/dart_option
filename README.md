# Option
This is an example implementation of the [Rust Option](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/) in Dart.

It's not meant to be production ready, but if you want, you can copy the file on `lib/option.dart` and put into your project.

# Usage
An Option can represent a value `Some` or no value `None`

```dart
Option<int>
```
